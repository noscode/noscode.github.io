Abstract:

Bayesian optimization is one of the most popular algorithms for optimization of expensive black-box functions within a limited time budget. We applied this technique in the setting of demographic inference, to the problem of inferring the history of populationsâ€™ development from genetic data sampled from present day individuals. Along the way, we used several non-orthodox tricks, like ensembling and log-transforms, improving over the vanilla Bayesian optimization. I will tell you about demographic inference, our approach and the results.

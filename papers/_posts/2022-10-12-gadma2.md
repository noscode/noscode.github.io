### Abstract

**Background**

Inference of complex demographic histories is a source of information about events that happened in the past of studied populations. Existing methods for demographic inference typically require input from the researcher in the form of a parameterized model. With an increased variety of methods and tools, each with its own interface, the model specification becomes tedious and error-prone. Moreover, optimization algorithms used to find model parameters sometimes turn out to be inefficient. The open-source software GADMA addresses these problems, providing automatic demographic inference. It proposes a common interface for several inference engines and provides global parameters optimization based on a genetic algorithm.

**Results**

Here, we introduce the new GADMA2 software and provide a detailed description of the added and expanded features. It has a renovated core code base, new inference engines, an updated optimization algorithm and a flexible setup for automatic model construction. We provide a full overview of GADMA2 enhancements, compare the performance of supported inference engines on simulated data and demonstrate an example of GADMA2 usage on two empirical datasets.

**Conclusions**

We demonstrate the better performance of a genetic algorithm in GADMA2 by comparing it to the initial version and other existing optimization approaches. Our experiments on simulated data indicate that GADMA2â€™s inference engines are able to provide accurate estimations of demographic parameters even for misspecified models. We improve model parameters for two empirical datasets of inbred species.
